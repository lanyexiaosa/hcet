# HCET: Hierarchical Clinical Embedding with Topic Modelling on Electronic Health Record for Predicting Depression
HCET is a temopral deep learning model which leverage the data heterogeneity of EHR by building hierachical embedding for diagosis, procedure, medication, demographic information and topic features from clinical notes. It learns the inherent structure for different types of EHR data and effectivelty process temporal information, which indicates a novel approach to constuct deep learnig models on EHR.
  
#### Running HCET

**STEP 1: Installation**  

1. We used [python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.6.5, and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) version 1.12.

2. [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) was also used and highly suggested for GPU computation.

3. Download/clone the HCET code  

**STEP 2: Prepare your dataset** 

**STEP 3: Run HCET code**
