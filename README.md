MiME is a novel EHR embedding algorithm that takes the relationship between diagnosis and its treatments into account when learning to represent each hospital visit.
  
#### Running HCET

**STEP 1: Installation**  

1. We used [python](https://www.python.org/) version 3.6.5, and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) version 1.12.

2. [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) was also used and highly suggested for GPU computation.

3. Download/clone the HCET code  

**STEP 2: Prepare your dataset** 

**STEP 3: Run HCET code**
